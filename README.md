Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
-The purpose of this analysis is to show the supervised machine learning models in order to compare between them and make a better decision of which to use, first of all i made extraction, transforming and loading of a database in order to make the ML models.


Results: Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models. Use screenshots of your outputs to support your results.

Summary: Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.
